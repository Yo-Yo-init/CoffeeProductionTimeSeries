# CoffeeProductionTimeSeries
Final project for Visualization class. 

This project focused on exploring and visualizing coffee production data by country over a period of several years. The data set contained information on coffee production levels in different countries, including the quantity of coffee produced and the year of production. The project aimed to uncover patterns and insights from this data using visual analytics techniques, such as animated bar plots and pie charts.

The project began by cleaning and preparing the data, followed by creating various visualizations using the ggplot2 package in R. These visualizations included animated bar plots showing changes in coffee production levels over time, as well as pie charts depicting the distribution of coffee production across different countries in a given year.

Insights from the visualizations revealed that Brazil was the largest coffee producer over the years, followed by Vietnam and Colombia. Additionally, there was a clear upward trend in coffee production across most countries over the period under study. Overall, the project demonstrated the value of using visual analytics techniques to explore and gain insights from complex data sets.
